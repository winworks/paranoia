# Paranoia

Paranoia is a re-implementation of [acts\_as\_paranoid](http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid) for Rails 3, using much, much, much less code.

You would use either plugin / gem if you wished that when you called `destroy` on an Active Record object that it didn't actually destroy it, but just "hid" the record. Paranoia does this by setting a `deleted_at` field to the current time when you `destroy` a record, and hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records which do not have a `deleted_at` field.

If you wish to actually destroy an object you may call `really_destroy!`.

## Installation & Usage

For Rails 3, please use version 1 of Paranoia:

```ruby
gem 'paranoia', '~> 1.0'
```

For Rails 4, please use version 2 of Paranoia:

```ruby
gem 'paranoia', '~> 2.0'
```

Of course you can install this from GitHub as well:

```ruby
gem 'paranoia', :github => 'radar/paranoia', :branch => 'master'
# or
gem 'paranoia', :github => 'radar/paranoia', :branch => 'rails4'
```

Then run:

```shell
bundle install
```

Updating is as simple as `bundle update paranoia`.

#### Run your migrations for the desired models

Run:

```shell
rails generate migration AddDeletedAtToClients deleted_at:datetime:index
```

and now you have a migration

```ruby
class AddDeletedAtToClients < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :clients, :deleted_at, :datetime
    add_index :clients, :deleted_at
  end
end
```

### Usage

#### In your model:

```ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_paranoid

  ...
end
```

Hey presto, it's there! Calling `destroy` will now set the `deleted_at` column:


```
>> client.deleted_at => nil
>> client.destroy => client
>> client.deleted_at => [current timestamp]
```

If you really want it gone *gone*, call `really_destroy!`

```
>> client.deleted_at => nil
>> client.really_destroy! => client
```

If you want a method to be called on destroy, simply provide a `before_destroy` callback:

```ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_paranoid

  before_destroy :some_method

  def some_method
    # do stuff
  end

  ...
end
```

If you want to use a column other than `deleted_at`, you can pass it as an option:

```ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_paranoid column: :destroyed_at

  ...
end
```

If you want to access soft-deleted associations, override the getter method:

```ruby
def product
  Product.unscoped { super }
end
```

If you want to find all records, even those which are deleted:

```ruby
Client.with_deleted
```

If you want to find only the deleted records:

```ruby
Client.only_deleted
```

If you want to check if a record is soft-deleted:

```ruby
client.destroyed?
```

If you want to restore a record:

```ruby
Client.restore(id)
```

If you want to restore a whole bunch of records:

```ruby
Client.restore([id1, id2, ..., idN])
```

If you want to restore a record and their dependently destroyed associated records:

```ruby
Client.restore(id, :recursive => true)
```

If you want callbacks to trigger before a restore:

```ruby
before_restore :callback_name_goes_here
```

For more information, please look at the tests.

## Acts As Paranoid Migration

You can replace the older acts_as_paranoid methods as follows:

| Old Syntax                 | New Syntax                     |
|:-------------------------- |:------------------------------ |
|`find_with_deleted(:all)`   | `Client.with_deleted`          |
|`find_with_deleted(:first)` | `Client.with_deleted.first`    |
|`find_with_deleted(id)`     | `Client.with_deleted.find(id)` |
